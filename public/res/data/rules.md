### SFW-Specific Rules
NOTE: SFW does NOT mean all-ages.  The SFW group is intended to be a place adults can discuss mature topics (i.e. taxes, bills) without having to have porn-spamming detract from the conversation.  Porn is fine!  Interruptions on other real-world topics.... not so much.<br><br>
1. Safe for Work (SFW) means if you wouldn't talk about it at work, don't bring it up here.
2. No sexual content allowed.  Light innuendo or humor is fine.  Overtly sexual material is not allowed.  Fetish content is not allowed.
3. Don’t flirt excessively or behave in a manner that makes others uncomfortable.
4. If in doubt, do NOT post it here and use the NSFW group instead.

### NSFW-Specific Rules
1. Not Safe for Work means the kind of content you’d typically view in private. We aim to be a loosely moderated space to share images, ideas, or desires too spicy for general conversation.
2. This is *NOT* a space to start fights, share shock content, or otherwise be ‘edgy’, an ‘internet tough guy’, or simply, a jerk. Maturity is required to remain here.
3. This chat is *NOT* limited to just porn. Adult topics of any type are welcome here.
4. This is *NOT* a space for politics. Light discussion of current events is fine; use the LI Furs Politics Thunderdome for anything past that. ((Consider a link to the group OR the carrd))
5. We aim to be inclusive of most kinks. Respect boundaries. We will not judge, but that doesn’t mean you can post anything freely. See below for notes on kinks.
