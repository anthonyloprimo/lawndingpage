**LawndingPage** is a simple community landing page platform that let's you easily create a central hub for your community!
<br><br>

You can get LawndingPage from [GitHub](https://github.com/anthonyloprimo/lawndingpage)
<br><br>


#### This is a test page that you can view.  
<br><br>

This is a **Basic Text Pane**.  These allow you to enter all sorts of text, using a language called **Markdown** and is rendered using a library called [Parsedown](https://parsedown.org/).  It allows full HTML and JS support as well, allowing you to fully customize the contents of these panes, building entirely new web pages within the site, for maximum customization!
<br><br>

For example, markdown only allows single line breaks.  To add an extra line, we can use traditional line break tags like `<br>`.

- In this list, links are provided both through normal markdown and html `<a>` tags!

As you can see, it's *very* simple to create unique pages with **not one line of code**!
<br><br>

**LawndingPage** also supports custom modules that expands the capabilities of your site.  Want a social media feed embedded?  Modules can allow you to build all sorts of custom features, and expose an interface to the admin panel so you don't have to think about coding - just add a module, enter the information you need, and you're off to the races!
